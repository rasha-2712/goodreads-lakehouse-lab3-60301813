A story of childhood friends, addie and Val who grow apart in high school and reunite later in life.

It's a young adult, Newberry book, so it's perhaps geared more for that audience in style, but I still found it interesting. I like books with quirky characters, and that's what this has. It's also a great story of discrimination in our own country towards Italian-Americans. We often don't think of discrimination against this group, so it was enlightening. I think adults who like young adult books will enjoy it, and young adults (in my opinion) should add it to their \"should read\" lists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-Slow and rambling. Terrifying in its statements of wars of extermination and the force of propaganda. \\n -Excellent for understanding the psychology and neuroses of future dictators and megalomaniacs. For example: Hitler's interest in his 'method' of reading - finding only the most relevant bits of information - could be interpreted as a demand for facts which fit pre-determined worldview. Obsessive patriotism as refuge from conflicted family life. Failed artist leading to view as romantic hero/savior/Lord of German Volk - note interest in Wagner. \\n -Not a 'good' book by any means, but one that must be read.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|I was given a copy of this book by Netgalley for an honest review. \\n Worth the Wait: A Sexy Summer Read (The Guthrie Brothers) is one to not miss out on! Nathan works part-time at Violet Shaw's restaurant as the \"Barbecue master\", he also works as the Sheriff. It is hard for Nathan to trust women, since his dead wife had an affair. He will now have to learn how to open his heart and trust once again. Violet has no time for a relationship while running the restaurant, but can she make time for Nathan? This is such a great story, heartwarming and romantic. Nathans son is perfect also. He will be a heart breaker! I have loved getting to know these characters and falling in love with them also! I always enjoy a Lori Foster novel. I know that I will not be disappointed. If you have not read this series, I recommend that you do. I give WORTH THE WAIT 5/5 STARS.|\n|A vampire who faints at the sight of blood?

The overuse of words like semen, womb, and sperm made it less erotic than it could have been. I like hot sex, but if a guy says he's gonna put his sperm in your womb, that's just not hot! And the 12 year gap was far too long. Maybe a few years, but 12? His son is nearly grown and all he contributed is the afore mentioned sperm! I was also a little creeped out by the way the H talked about, and treated, the h like she was a child. She wasn't even that innocent to begin with, so it came off rather silly. I know this is Chance's first book, so I hope to see improvement in the future.
